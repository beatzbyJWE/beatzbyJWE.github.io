### UVA Data Science Program 

[Haiti Relief Project](/machinelearnjoe/Disaster%20Relief%20Project.htm)
In this project I will:
<ul>
  <li>Show how data science could have augment administration of life-saving relief in a short timeframe after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.</li>
  <li>Compare traditional classification techniques with machine learning methods for solving a color-based classification problem.</li>
   <li>Iterate through a simple cost/benefit analysis method where a tailored "F-Score" balances precision and recall during classification.</li>
  <li>Wrangle and combine large datasets. </li>
  <li>Output a color palette based on RGB data.</li>
  <li>Map Lat-Long data using mapview package.</li> 
</ul>

## Personal Data Science Work

[Simple Data Wrangling Practice](/machinelearnjoe/Data%Wrangling%Practice.htm)
I completed this exercise early into data science because it provides a great baseline for:
<ul>
  <li>

[Using NLP to Validate Data](/machinelearnjoe/Data%Wrangling%Practice.htm)
In my work life I manage a team that handles data validation. Here is an exercise that I did on on public data as a proof of concept for a data validation technique. The goal was to: 
<ol>
  <li>Locate and extract "year" from long text "notes".</li>
  <li>Compare this year to another value in the same record.</li>
  <li>Discuss accuracy of the results.</li>

[Treating Structured Data as Unstructured to Learn about Data Quality](/machinelearnjoe/Data%Wrangling%Practice.htm)
In this project I will:
<li>Use k-means clustering to group data with a known structure</li>
<li>Use neural networks to do the same thing. </li>
