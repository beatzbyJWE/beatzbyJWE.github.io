# Portfolio
---

In my portfolio I provide some of my work in data science across my professional and academic careers. I will be adding to this regularly as I continue to learn about and adopt the principles of data science.

## UVA Data Science Program 

Here are a few of the things I am most proud of working on during my time enrolled at the University of Virginia School of Data Science.

[Haiti Relief Project](/machinelearnjoe/Disaster%20Relief%20Project.htm)

In this project I will:
<ul>
  <li>Show how data science could have augmented the provision of life-saving relief after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.</li>
  <li>Compare traditional classification techniques with machine learning methods for solving a color-based classification problem.</li>
   <li>Iterate through a simple cost/benefit analysis method where a tailored "F-Score" balances precision and recall during classification.</li>
  <li>Wrangle and combine large datasets. </li>
  <li>Output a color palette based on RGB data.</li>
  <li>Map Lat-Long data using mapview package.</li> 
</ul>

[Principal Components and Hierarchical Clustering](beatzbyJWE.github.io/blob/master/PC%20%26%20Hierarchical%20Cluster.htm)
In this exercise are solutions for classwork related to hierarchical clustering and establishing variance explained by principal components starting by creating loading vectors from the original data. A colleague demonstrated the math to do so and I coded it in R.

## Personal Data Science Work

[Simple Data Wrangling Practice](/DataWrangling_Practice.html)

I completed this exercise early into my excursion in data science because it provides a great R crash course in:
<ul>
  <li>Dealing with formatting and incorrect or undesirable data types.</li>
  <li>Handling NAs and understanding outliers.</li>
  <li>Organizing a data file.</li>
</ul>

## Work

[Using NLP to Validate Data](/machinelearnjoe/Data%Wrangling%Practice.htm)

In my job I manage a team that handles data validation. Here is an exercise that I did on on public data as a proof of concept for a data validation technique. The goal was to: 
<ol>
  <li>Locate and extract "year" from long text "notes".</li>
  <li>Compare this year to another value in the same record.</li>
  <li>Discuss accuracy of the results.</li>
</ol>

[Treating Structured Data as Unstructured to Learn about Data Quality](/machinelearnjoe/Data%Wrangling%Practice.htm)

In this project I will:
<li>Use k-means clustering to group data with a known structure</li>
<li>Use neural networks to do the same thing. </li>
